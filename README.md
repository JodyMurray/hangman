**Hangman**

*Responsive design shot goes here*

This game is based from the original Hangman game we all grew up with. A random word is selected and you're given the number of letters it contains. Guessing a new letter each go, if you choose correct, the terminal will tell you and show you where it belongs in the randonly chosen word, if you guess wrong, a line will be added to the "hangman" until it is complete.

The words used are on a separate page and are chosen randomly from many, many words. The game only gives you 7 lives, which is the amount of wrong answers to complete the "hangman" image. 

This project is the third of five projects that needs to be completed in order to receve a diploma in Software Development from The Code Institute.

## UX 

## User Demographic
 This application has been designed for users of all ages just for some fun, to test their knowledge and see if they are any good at the class game, Hangman!
 
 ## User Goals
 * To have some fun and play Hangman!
 * To have users test their knowledge.
 * To pass the time.

 ## Design 
The design has been inspired by a tutorial demonstration I came across: PUT IN LINK
The aim for this website is to create a user friendly terminal based application, that also retrieves and displays current and new data. The landing page provides a menu selection: Play Game, See Rules, See Highscores, or Exit application.
