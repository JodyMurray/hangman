**Hangman**

*Responsive design shot goes here*

This game is based from the original Hangman game we all grew up with. A random word is selected and you're given the number of letters it contains. Guessing a new letter each go, if you choose correct, the terminal will tell you and show you where it belongs in the randonly chosen word, if you guess wrong, a line will be added to the "hangman" until it is complete.

The words used are on a separate page and are chosen randomly from many, many words. The game only gives you 7 lives, which is the amount of wrong answers to complete the "hangman" image. 

This project is the third of five projects that needs to be completed in order to receve a diploma in Software Development from The Code Institute.
